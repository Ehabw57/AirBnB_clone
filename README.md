# AirBnB

A fullstack web application using Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## The Console

A command interpreter to administrate/manage the AirBnB storage and objects written in Python.

#### How it works?

After cloning the repository in your host machine run the console.py script

```sh
$ python3 console.py
```

An interactive prompt will appear with the label `(hbnb)`, now you can start doing CRUD operations by commanding `(hbnb)`.

For example, to create a new User instence:
```hbnb
(hbnb) create User
```
